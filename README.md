## How to install

I haven't uploaded this to pip yet, install directly from GitHub:

```
pip install huh@git+https://github.com/paramsingh/huh.git@v0.0.2
```

You'll need to provide an OpenAI API key. Add one to your keyring via `hub setup`.

Note: All code on hub runs locally on your computer. The API key is stored in your OS's keyring.
