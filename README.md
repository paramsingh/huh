## How to install

I haven't uploaded this to pip yet, install directly from GitHub:

```
pip install huh@git+https://github.com/paramsingh/huh.git@v0.0.2
```

You'll need to provide an OpenAI API key. Here are the [instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) on how to get one.
Add one to your keyring via `huh setup`.

Note: All code on hub runs locally on your computer. The API key is stored in your OS's keyring.

## How to use?

Just run `huh` and enter your command.
